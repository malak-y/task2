 Task Two : Image Gallery
 Create an Image Slider using only HTML, CSS, and
 JavaScript, without using any external libraries or
 frameworks. Ensure that the slider is responsive across all
 screen sizes, from mobile devices to large screens.
 Basic Requirements:
 1-The slider should contain at least 3 images.
 2-There should be buttons to navigate between images
 (forward and backward).
 3-The images should automatically transition every 3-5
 seconds.
 4-When the user hovers over the slider, the automatic
 transition should pause.
 Suggested Enhancements:
 1-Add Transition Effects: Include smooth transition effects
 when switching between images to enhance the slider's
 appearance.
 2-Add Pagination Indicators: Add dots below the slider to
 indicate the currently active image, which can also be used
 to navigate between images.
 3-Enable Swipe Functionality: Make the slider swipeable on
 touch screens to allow users to navigate between images
 by swiping.
 4-Different Image Layouts: Experiment with different
 layouts for displaying images, such as stacking them side
 by side in a staggered manner or adding 3D effects during
 transitions
